Shoppers will now see the store's actual password complexity requirements in the tooltip on the new customer registration form, preventing confusion and failed registration attempts. The schema() function in core/vibes/soul/form/dynamic-form/schema.ts now accepts an optional second parameter passwordComplexity to enable dynamic password validation. The DynamicForm, DynamicFormSection components and their associated server actions also accept an optional passwordComplexity prop that flows through to the schema. Action Required: If you have custom registration or password forms and want to use store-specific password complexity settings, fetch passwordComplexitySettings from the GraphQL API (under site.settings.customers.passwordComplexitySettings) and pass it to your DynamicFormSection component and maintain it in your server action's state. If you don't pass it, password validation defaults to: minimum 8 characters, at least one number, and at least one special character. Conflict Resolution: If merging into custom forms, ensure the passwordComplexity prop is threaded through: Page → DynamicFormSection → DynamicForm → useActionState → schema(). In server actions, add passwordComplexity?: Parameters<typeof schema>[1] to your state type and include it in all return statements to maintain state consistency.
