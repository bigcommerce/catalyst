Allows the ability to consume a [storefront token](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-authentication/tokens#storefront-tokens). This new token will allow Catalyst to create `customerAccessToken`'s whenever a user logs into their account. This change doesn't include consuming the either token, only adding the ability to pass it in.
