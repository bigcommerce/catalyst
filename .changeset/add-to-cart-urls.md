Add support for add-to-cart URLs via route handlers. Supports both `/cart.php` (Stencil compatibility) and `/add-to-cart` (Catalyst-native) routes. Enables adding products to cart using query parameters (product_id, sku, qty, couponcode) and supports both 'add' (redirect to cart) and 'buy' (redirect to checkout) actions.
