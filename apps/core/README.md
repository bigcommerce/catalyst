<br />

**Catalyst** is the composable, fully customizable headless ecommerce storefront framework for
[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/). Catalyst is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), uses
our [React](https://react.dev/) storefront components, and is backed by the
[GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql).

By choosing Catalyst, you'll have a fully-functional storefront within a few seconds, and spend zero time on wiring
up APIs or building SEO, Accessibility, and Performance-optimized ecommerce components you've probably written many
times before. You can instead go straight to work building your brand and making this your own.
