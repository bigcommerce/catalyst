# Security

Since Catalyst is optimized for production commerce sites utilizing BigCommerce, it benefits from the security standards of BigCommerce's platform in addition to the implementation of strong best practices for the Next.js framework.

## Best practices implemented

### Limited Data Access

Out-of-the-box, Catalyst is 100% powered by a GraphQL Storefront API that has zero access to admin functionality. It's scoped only to the storefront and either anonymous or authenticated shoppers.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Catalyst implements a default Content Security Policy (CSP), which can be extended to meet your organizationâ€™s specific security standards. This enables you to specify the sources of content that are allowed to be loaded on your site, which helps to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

More details on customizing your CSP policy can be found here:

## Framework benefits

### Next.js Security Record
