- [#1194](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/pull/1194) [`b455b05`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/b455b05a6121b005bd5147a25c964b9554b1b350) Thanks [@BC-krasnoshapka](https://github.com/BC-krasnoshapka)! - Add basic support for Google Analytics via [Big Open Data Layer](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/integrations/hosted-analytics). BODL and GA4 integration is encapsulated in `bodl` library which hides current complexity and limitations that will be improved in future. It can be extended with more events and integrations with other analytics providers later. Data transformation from Catalyst data models to BODL and firing events is done in client components, as only frontend events are supported by BODL for now.

  List of currently supported events:

  - View product category
  - View product page
  - Add product to cart
  - View cart
  - Remove product from cart

  In order to configure you need to specify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` environment variable which is essentially your GA4 ID.

### Minor Changes

- [#1178](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/pull/1178) [`f592d9f`](https://github.com/bigcommerce/catalyst/commit/f592d9fe0b71ddd7ceb5e1326ea0280f7b90c3c9) Thanks [@jorgemoya](https://github.com/jorgemoya)! - This refactor changes the structure of our UI components by replacing composability with a prop-based configuration. This change simplifies the use of our components, eliminating the need to build them individually from a composable approach. Additionally, it provides a single location for all class customizations, improving the experience when fully customizing the component. We believe this approach will make it easier to use components correctly and safeguard against incorrect usage. Ultimately, by adopting a prop-based configuration, we aim to achieve full replaceability and simplify theming for our components.

  Before refactor:

  ```
  <Accordions>
      <AccordionsItem>
          <AccordionsTrigger>
              Title 1
          </AccordionsTrigger>
          <AccordionsContent>
              Item Content 1
          </AccordionsContent>
      </AccordionsItem>
      <AccordionsItem>
          <AccordionsTrigger>
              Title 2
          </AccordionsTrigger>
          <AccordionsContent>
              Item Content 2
          </AccordionsContent>
      </AccordionsItem>
  </Accordions>
  ```

  After refactor:

  ```
  <Accordions accordions={[
      {value: 'Title 1', content: 'Item Content 1'},
      {value: 'Title 2', content: 'Item Content 2'}
  ]}>
  ```

  Before refactor:

  ```
  <Select
      onValueChange={onSort}
      value={value}
  >
      <SelectContent>
          <SelectItem value="featured">Featured</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="newest">Newest</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="best_selling">Best selling</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="a_to_z">A to Z</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="z_to_a">Z to A</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="best_reviewed">By reviews</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="lowest_price">Price ascending</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="highest_price">Price descending</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="relevance">Relevance</SelectItem>
      </SelectContent>
  </Select>
  ```

  After refactor:

  ```
  <Select

      options={[
          { value: 'featured', label: 'Featured' },
          { value: 'newest', label: 'Newest' },
