## Pull Requests

First ensure that your feature isn't already being developed or considered (see open PRs and issues). 
If it is, please consider contributing to those initiatives.

## Issues / Bugs
 
* Please include a clear, specific title and replicable description.

* Please include your environment, OS, and any exceptions/backtraces that occur. The more
information that is given, the more likely we can debug and fix the issue.

**If you find a security bug, please do not post as an issue. Send directly to security@bigcommerce.com 
instead.**

## Other Ways to Contribute

* Consider reporting bugs, contributing to test coverage, or helping spread the word about Catalyst.

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference pull requests and external links liberally
