# Reporting security issues
If you have found a security vulnerability in an active open-source repository created and owned by BigCommerce, please report it to our [public bug bounty program](https://bugcrowd.com/bigcommerce). If you would prefer to submit via email, please send your report to [security@bigcommerce.com](mailto:security@bigcommerce.com)

*Note: Only submissions to our bounty program on BugCrowd will be eligible for bounties. Bounty eligibility and amounts are determined according to the program guidelines.*

Please ***do not*** use public issues to report security vulnerabilities.

Bugs in 3rd-party modules should be reported to those modulesâ€™ maintainers.
